* `give_the_line`: This function is to extract the string I have until reaching `\n`, and also make the pointer of the `full_string` be after this new line.

* `cut_the_rest(char *string)`: Cut the rest after returning line so you could keep the string after the `\n` in the static var.

* `read_file(int fd, char *full_string, char *temp)`:read from the buffer and save in the static var.
